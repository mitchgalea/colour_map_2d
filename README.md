Colour Map 2D utilises an occupancy grid and Point Cloud from an RGBD camera to add colour to a occupancy grid map
Colour Map 2D detects colours that are user set in colour.h, it aims at classifying obstacles as a colour that is listed or none
It uses a histogram filter for each grid cell that stores the probabilities of each colour - a grid cell is filtered when a point cloud
corresponding to the cell position are inputted
Transfers this information to an image showing the coloured map
